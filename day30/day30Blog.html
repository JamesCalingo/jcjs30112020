        <p><b>DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY: HOWEVER LONG THIS POST IS REMAINS</b></p>

<p>For the final day of the JavaScript 30, we have a classic arcade game: Whack-a-Mole! The mole will randomly pop out of one of the "holes", and you have to click it before it gets away. Each time you do, a point is added to your score.</p>
        
        <p>The game lasts for (a determinate amount of time that I'm keeping secret), and at the end of that time, you're given your score as well as the current high score. Try and see if you can get the high score!<br>(My high score during testing was 9)</p>
        
        <p>There are a few different things I could have done for this, but most of them involved copywritten characters (to replace the moles), so I decided to stick with what the project directory had. I know I said I didn't want to just borrow CSS, but I think this one kinda required it otherwise the game would look REALLY different (and not in a good way). I DID have to get "creative" with the start button though: I couldn't figure out a way to get it centered in the page until I tried playing with the margins.</p>

        <p>As a game lover who has enjoyed programming small games in the past (one of my first "real" web apps was a psychic game after all), I had some experience with a few of the things involved in making a JavaScript game, so there were a few things I added to this one. The big one is a high score indicator using local storage - your browser (remember, local storage is browser specific) will keep track of your high score as long as you allow it.</p>
        
        <p>Also, for whatever reason, the tutorial for this didn't include a indicator that the game had ended, so I threw one in as a function.</p>

        <p>...And that's been the JavaScript 30 for me. I have my final thoughts on the whole project <a href="..wrapUp.html">here</a> if you're interested (or you can use the link below), and I really do hope that you are.</p>
