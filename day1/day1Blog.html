    <h1>DAY 1: JavaScript Drum Kit</h1>
    <h2><a href="day1.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>
    
    <p>One of my closest friends is a drummer. He got married back in August (to another one of my closest friends), and
      I've known him and his (now) wife for well over a decade now (they weren't even dating when I met both of them).
    </p>

    <p>What does that have to do with me creating a virtual drum kit? I'm not entirely sure. I just thought it was
      interesting.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this virtual drum machine (it really feels more like a drum machine than a drum kit/set) is the first day
      of the project. To use it, simply press the keys on the
      keyboard that correspond to the sounds as displayed on the page (a for the "clap" sound effect, "s" for the hi
      hat, etc.)</p>

    <p>For the most part, it wasn't that bad, but there was something interesting I learned:</p>

    <p>When calling functions, I'm used to using the parentheses (); for example, if you define a function named
      "doStuff" and then you want to actually use it later in the code, you would usually do "doStuff()".</p>

    <p>When I tried doing that with the functions written in the js file, I got errors. To fix it, all I had to do was
      simply name the functions without using the parentheses (i.e. just write "doStuff" instead of "doStuff()"). I'm
      not entirely sure why this is, but I suspect it may have to do with the event bindings.</p>

    <p>Also, while I did use some of the stock CSS that came with the app, I adjusted it quite a bit for my "tastes", if
      you will. For example, those of you who have done this challenge will instantly notice that the screaming people
      background is
      missing; I thought it was kinda irrelevant to the app at hand, so I decided to use a plain background (for now). I
      also changed a few of the names of the sounds (namely the "tink"); the longer names may cause some visual
      weirdness on smaller/horizontal screens, but it doesn't affect how the app works.
    </p>

    <p>Due to the use of keyboard events, this app will not work on mobile devices. I had this issue come up in the past
      once, and my solution was to implement a text field to click on so that the keyboard will come up. I could do that
      here sometime in the future, but I'm not sure.</p>

    <p>(P.S.: Remember yesterday how I said there was a reason I wasn't sure about using TypeScript for this project? That's because I wanted to use ts-check for this, but it kept producing errors due to the audio for the key events being
      bound to "Element". I feel like if I could figure out how to make ts-check happy, that would help me understand
      both JavaScript and TypeScript immensely.)</p>
