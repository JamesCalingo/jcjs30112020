      <h1>DAY 20: Speech Recognition</h1>
      <h2><a href="day20.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

<p>We're approaching the home stretch.</p>

<p>Today's app is basically just speech recognition. Once you allow the app access to your microphone, it will interpret whatever you say and then show it on the page.</p>

<p>Once again, this app is supposed to be served by a server, but I was able to have it running without the server. However, I learned something VERY important and kinda weird about the <code>SpeechRecognition( )</code> object in this process:</p>

<p>according to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/SpeechRecognition">MDN</a>, this only works on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. I tried it on Firefox and it gave me a TypeError</p>
