      <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>
        <h2></h2>

      <p>So that's been my journey through the JavaScript 30.</p>

      <p>I've definitely learned quite a bit through doing this - and not just about JavaScript.</p>

      <p>Yes, I have learned a lot about array methods, event listeners, and query selectors, but there has been so much more involved in this project. For proof, look no further than Day 28, when I nearly wrecked this whole thing and had to get creative in order to not lose stuff. While that didn't spark my interest in investigating code editors, it did help that I had that knowledge to make things easier for myself.</p>

      <p>Of course, there's also the idea that this gave me a shot of confidence that I can do this. Coding, in some ways, is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle - you have to figure out which pieces go together to make things work. However, knowing that is only half of the process - you have to know what the puzzle pieces are, what they look like, what they do, and how they interact with one another.</p>

      <p>Originally, I thought this would be 30 applications that bhahbha, but quickly learned that wasn't the case. I hope that I was able to communicate well on those days when there was more writing than JavaScripting - especially since the wrap up video for this project encourages you to spread your knowledge.</p>

      <p>If I had to pick a favorite project, it would probably be the text-to-speech app (Day 23). Text-to-speech is surprisingly fun to mess around with, and making the voices say different things (mainly memes) was amusing while trying to adjust the app to my liking (for example, see what happens if you leave the text box empty). Conversely, the compass app was probably my least favorite - mainly due to all the issues with the geolocation object. However, that geolocation object is going to be key for a future project idea I have, so it was also one of the more important things I did. There are also other things that I think have important uses in the future - the most prominent one being the panels thing on Day 5.</p>

      <p>So what's next for me?</p>

      <p>Job hunting.</p>

      <p>Part of me doing this project was trying to improve my knowledge/skills to be more competitive in the job market. In the past year or so, I have vascilated between thinking I'm relatively close to a breakthrough in my job hunt and thinking that I'm nowhere close to being able to land a job. In doing this project, I more or less putting my job hunt on pause to try and focus on it. Whether or not that was a good idea is yet to be seen, but I think that I have a better understanding of myself and what it means to be a developer.</p>

      <p>Having said that, though, there is still work to be done. I still don't really feel like I have a "killer" project ready yet (though I've been working on one), and there are a few things that I need to work on before I can safely say I feel ready to interview, but I'm getting there.</p>

      <p>One of the hardest parts of job hunting in a field like this, IMO, is finding things to do. Now that this is done, I'm basically in a vast sea of "what now?" - I've heard so many different things regarding skills, networking, and portfolio/projects, and I need to figure out what will work best for me. Again, I've learned quite a bit in this past month, but there are still a lot of things out there that I feel need some work, so there's that.</p>

      <p>If you want to follow my next steps, you can see my past and future work at my <a href="https://jamescalingo.dev">personal portfolio page</a>, or if you're interested in reading what I have to say, <a href="https://jamescalingo.com">I have a blog</a> that I'm hoping to update more. Both of these are actually among my future projects: My portfolio is largely unupdated since mid-spring 2020 (and a bit visually lacking for a full stack developer), and the blog is on a borrowed template (I want my own).</p>

      <p>There are so many other things that I want to explore as well. You may remember me mentioning a browser-based IDE during the chaos that was Day 28; I'm actually considering using it to develop an app 100% online (no downloading it to my poor 2015 Macbook that's over 90% full). Of course, there are other things to explore; I doubt that refactoring THIS particular project is in the works, but there are things in here that could be useful for me in the future...</p>

      <p>I want to leave with a thought for you all:</p>

      <p>This field of coding/software development is a field where there's always something to learn. One of the major reasons I did this was because it did framework-free JavaScript; yes, React is nice and all, but you never know when something new is going to show up and draw everyone's attention. If you rely too heavily on "tricks" from some major JS framework (looking at you jQuery) and suddenly the market shifts away from it, then you'd better be prepared to adapt or risk getting left behind.</p>

      <p>You never know what type of people you'll work with - and what they'll expect of you. All you can do is try your hardest to make syure you're performing at a satisfactory level - not just for yourself, but for others as well.</p>

      <p>Hope to see you around soon.</p>
