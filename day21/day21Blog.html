      <h1>DAY 21: Compass and Speedometer</h1>
      <h2><a href="day21.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

<p>By now, I've discussed the idea of mobile compatability with this project a few times - mainly for the projects that, unfortunately, aren't mobile compatable.</p>

<p>Today's project, however, is actually the reverse of that - it's meant for mobile first. It's (supposed to be) a compass and speedometer, so unless you're using your computer in some form of mobile transportation device, it's not really going to work (Is what I originally thought - more on this in a sec).</p>

<p>This is the final project that was supposed to require a server, but I was able to get it to work (ish) without one. I believe that this is due to security stuff (like https). Also, for Mac users, this tutorial actually used Xcode to simulate motion. However, since my computer has limited space and I have had little reason to use xCode in the past, I didn't use it.</p>

<p>Until I dove deeper into this app.</p>

<p>The biggest issue was the Geolocation object: for whatever reason, it kept returning <code>null</code> for the data that I needed: speed and heading (direction) After a few Google searches, I learned that the app working hinges on the <code>speed</code> value: if the device has no way to provide a speed, then it (and heading) will remain <code>null</code>. I TRIED to figure out if an iPhone had a native speed detector, but just found a bunch of apps that measure your speed and not any answers about the hardware itself. I don't know how those apps work, but if they're using pointB-pointA/time, then that's not going to help.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided to download Xcode and see what would happen if I tried using its iOS simulator. I got the speedometer to work but the compass wasn't; I couldn't figure out my way to see what the values were from console.logging.</p>

<p>I also found out that the videos for this course are on YouTube! I went to today's app to see if there were relevant comments and there were! One of them mentioned trying Microsoft Edge, so I did - and sure enough, it ended up...kinda working. Not really enough to the point where I would say that it "works", but it seemed to be getting there (mainly in that I tested it while driving and it was VERY off from my car speedometer, likely due to how the Geolocation API works).</p>

<p>Overall, I won't say that this is a complete failure despite not really being able to showcase a working app, because I learned a lot about geolocation, which I may need for an upcoming project.</p>

<p>(Also, for those wondering, that compass is a giant XML object. I usually try to hand-write the HTML for these, but there was NO WAY I was writing THAT.)</p>
