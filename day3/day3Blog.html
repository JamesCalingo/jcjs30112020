    <h1>DAY 3: Playing with CSS Variables</h1>
    <h2><a href="day3.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

    <p>This is just a little app where you can mess around with some CSS stuff. Use the sliders to adjust how much
      spacing is around the embedded image, how blurry the image is, or the color of the background of the embedded
      image.</p>

    <p>When I saw that the project was going to be messing with CSS variables using a stock image, my first thought was
      to use an image of the city of Boston. Ironically, this ended up being far and away the hardest part of the project: I didn't want to use an image that I had to pay for, and I couldn't find any good free images (or any photos I had taken of the skyline), so I ended up using Wikipedia. I realize that I could have used an image of something else (like stuff in Boston Common or the Cambridge skyline), but I felt this was the best way to represent the city.</p>

    <p>Luckily, I was not only able to find hex values for the colors of the Boston Red Sox (the default red for the image background), but of Fenway Park as well - that's the green of the webpage background. I know it doesn't look that green on your monitor, but if you look at images of the inside of Fenway Park then you'll probably realize that it kinda matches up.</p>

    <p>One last thing: I'm not sure if it's just Google Chrome being weird, but when you change colors, the change won't take effect until you move your mouse over the little "button" that indicates the color.</p>
