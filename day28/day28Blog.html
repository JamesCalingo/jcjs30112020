      <h1>DAY 28: Video Speed 2: Quickman Edition</h1>
      <h2><a href="day28.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

        <p>Remember how I did a custom video player interface back on day 11? This is similar to that, but it's for only speed. It looks and behaves differently though: As you move your mouse up and down the bar on the left, the speed of the video changes.</p>
        
        <p>Like back then, the hardest part of this was finding an actual video. I have a bunch of those Animal Crossing clips, but none of them are longer than 30 seconds due to how recording clips on Nintendo Switch works (I felt 30 seconds was WAY too short for this). I thought about just editing a bunch of those clips together, but it seemed like more work than was necessary. However, searching through my flies led me to an old video that I thought would be good for the app...and that's where the real "fun" begins.</p>
        
        <p>And by fun, I mean <b>ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE OF A CRAP SHOW.</b></p>
        
        <p>Y'see, making and testing the app was fine. Everything worked as </p>

        <p>Anyway...</p>
        
        <p>Back to the app at hand, I swear this is the last day I'm going to heavily borrow from the stock CSS. It's just that this app in particular requires things that involve the stock CSS, and while I know that it's not necessary, I'm not quite sure if I want to deal with adjusting the JS for different CSSing.</p>
        
        <p>Also, I'm not going to lie: Not sure I'm a fan of having the speed increase the lower the mouse is. There may be a way to configure it so that as the bar fills toward the top, it gets faster, but I'm not entirely sure on the details for that...</p>
