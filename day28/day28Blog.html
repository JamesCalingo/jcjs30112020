    <h1>DAY 28: Video Speed 2: Quickman Edition</h1>
    <h2><a href="day28.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

    <p>Remember how I did a custom video player interface back on day 11? This is similar to that, but it's for only
      speed. It looks and behaves differently though: As you move your mouse up and down the bar on the left, the speed
      of the video changes.</p>

    <p>Like back then, the hardest part of this was finding an actual video. I have a bunch of those Animal Crossing
      clips, but none of them are longer than 30 seconds due to how recording clips on Nintendo Switch works (I felt 30
      seconds was WAY too short for this). I thought about just editing a bunch of those clips together, but it seemed
      like more work than was necessary. However, searching through my flies led me to an old video that I thought would
      be good for the app...and that's where the real "fun" begins.</p>

    <p>And by fun, I mean <b>ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE OF A CRAP SHOW.</b></p>

    <p>Y'see, making and testing the app was fine. Everything worked as I expected, so I figured that it should be okay
      to push to GitHub. I decided to do so by using VSCode's git tools as opposed to the terminal.</p>

    <p>However, I realized that I forgot to update the main page with the links for today, so I did that and tried to
      push the changes via Terminal this time.</p>

    <p>Terminal took ages to try and push the changes, and then failed because the video I put in was too big. I figured
      that if the vid was too big, then just replace it with a smaller video and that should make things better!</p>

    <p>Right?</p>

    <h1 class="mid-text-h1">NOPE!</h1>

    <p>I tried deleting the video, making a new folder, gitignoring - nothing worked. Every time I tried to push, it was
      trying to commit any and all changes involving the video - and failing every time. It seemed like there was no way
      around it - my local repo was essentially condemned.</p>

    <p>Thank goodness for GitHub!</p>

    <p>I'm sure a lot of you aren't super aware of this, but you can change files <i>on GitHub itself</i> - assuming you
      have the permissions to do so. I've done a few READMEs via this method in the past, but never anything beyond
      that. I don't recommend it though, as it's a bit cumbersome and fairly limited - for example, you don't have
      access to a lot of text editor features such as autocompletion of text and brackets.</p>

    <p>However, remember yesterday when I mentioned the Brackets text editor? Turns out there's another one called <a
        href="https://theia-ide.org/" target="blank">Theia</a>/<a href="https://www.gitpod.io/"
        target="blank">Gitpod</a>* that's web/browser based, and I had connected it to my GitHub already in trying to get it set up for myself. I was able to
      open the repository there, make the files and changes (relatively) quickly, and then delete the repository from my
      local computer and redownload it to get it working again.</p>

    <p>Could I have just tried using a YouTube video or something for the app? Well, I tried a YouTube link and that
      didn't work (no file extension type), so that's a no. I could've just uploaded the video to Dropbox or Google
      Drive and gone from there as well, but I'd rather not because I don't really use Dropbox and my Google Drive is
      getting quite full.</p>

    <p>Also, yes, I am aware of <code>git revert</code> (mainly due to some wacky stuff involving my portfolio in the
      past), but I'm not entirely sure how it works...</p>

    <p>Anyway...</p>

    <p>Back to the app at hand, I swear this is the last day I'm going to heavily borrow from the stock CSS. It's just
      that this app in particular requires things that involve the stock CSS, and while I know that it's not necessary,
      I'm not quite sure if I want to deal with adjusting the JS for different CSSing.</p>

    <p>Also, I'm not going to lie: Not sure I'm a fan of having the speed increase the lower the mouse is. There may be
      a way to configure it so that as the bar fills toward the top, it gets faster, but I'm not entirely sure on the
      details for that...</p>

    <p>If you want to see the blog post for what I originally had for today (because I threw a funny anecdote in there),
      <a href="day28BlogOld.html">you can check it out here</a>.</p>

    <p>*(I don't entirely know what exactly Theia/Gitpod are or the difference between them, but I do know that Theia is
      based on VSCode...)</p>
