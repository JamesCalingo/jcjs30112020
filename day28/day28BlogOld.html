        <p>Remember how I did a custom video player interface back on day 11? This is similar to that, but it's for only speed. It looks and behaves differently though: As you move your mouse up and down the bar on the left, the speed of the video changes.</p>
        
        <p>Like back then, the hardest part of this was finding an actual video. I have a bunch of those Animal Crossing clips, but none of them are longer than 30 seconds due to how recording clips on Nintendo Switch works (I felt 30 seconds was WAY too short for this). I thought about just editing a bunch of those clips together, but it seemed like more work than was necessary. However, searching through my flies led me to the video you see in today's app, and for those who need context, let me provide some (I may have explained this somewhere before, but I don't remember):</p>
        
        <p>Y'see kids, back in the day, we used to do this thing called "travelling". It was awesome: you could go somewhere hours away from your house and stay there for a little while. You'd be able to take in the scenery, eat the local food, buy hand crafted souveniers, and so much more!</p>
        
        <p>We even used to be able to travel to different countries too! If you had this thing called a "valid passport", you could go to almost any country in the world (depending on where your passport came from). For example, I was going to put a video of my trip to a mystical land known as Quebec, Canada, but I couldn't find it on my computer and then I realized that it was 13 minutes long (and probably would have GitHub yelling at me).</p>
        
        <p>Back to the app at hand, I swear this is the last day I'm going to heavily borrow from the stock CSS. It's just that this app in particular requires things that involve the stock CSS, and while I know that it's not necessary, I'm not quite sure if I want to deal with adjusting the JS for different CSSing.</p>
        
        <p>Also, I'm not going to lie: Not sure I'm a fan of having the speed increase the lower the mouse is. There may be a way to configure it so that as the bar fills toward the top, it gets faster, but I'm not entirely sure on the details for that...</p>
        
        <p>(P.S.: If you're looking for travel recommendations for the after times, Quebec is a lovely place - it feels like Europe, but without the trans-Atlantic flight)</p>
