JamesCalingo does the JavaScript 30 - November 2020

# What this is
The JavaScript 30 is a coding challenge designed by Wes Bos where you create 30 different JavaScript apps using only vanilla JavaScript.

I wanted to do it to get some consistent coding in as well as improve my JavaScript skills - sure, I can become a React master, but what will happen if a new framework comes in and completely blows React out of the water?

Each day, I'll update this with a new app until I've finished the whole thing. It's a little tricky to try and make READMEs for each day, but I do want to document what the app is, how it works, and some of my processes as a blog, so each blog post basically doubles as that app's README.

# Technology Used

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

...and that's it. No React, no JQuery, no Bootstrap - just regular HTML, CSS, and JS.
