    <h1>DAY 16: Mouse Movement Effects</h1>
    <h2><a href="day16.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

    <p>This one's about mousemove events and text effects. Move your mouse around the page and check out what happens to
      the text shadows.</p>

    <p>To be honest, I'm really not sure what to say about this one. The most involved part of it involves using math to
      calculate how far the shadows should move from the source text. Outside of that, it was fairly simple.</p>

    <p>There is ONE BIG thing I learned about today: <code>contenteditable</code> (i.e. letting the user change text on
      a page without an input field).</p>

    <p>I'm also not sure what to think of this. Yes, it does look like a cool effect, but it honestly feels a bit more
      flashy than anything else. I doubt there's very many practical uses for either the shadow effects or editable HTML
      elements, but I may find uses down the line for mousemove things...</p>

    <p>P.S.: I tried to get the effect on THIS page as well, but it didn't quite work out. It's probably because of
      hard-coded values in the JavaScript file (for the math I discussed above). Also, as I'm writing this before
      uploading it online, I don't know how this will behave on mobile...it was a little strange when I was testing it
      in dev tools.</p>
