    <h1>DAY 0: This whole site.</h1>
    <h2>(NOTE: There is no link for this one)</h2>

    <p>This is NOT one of the JavaScript 30 projects. Heck, this isn't even a JS thing - it's just me setting up the
      HTML and CSS of this site!</p>

    <p>Why am I making this post then? It's because this whole process took a bit longer than I expected.</p>

    <p>For starters, this was supposed to be the intro to this whole project, so I guess I'll do that. So with that in
      mind...</p>

    <h1>Hi!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to me doing the JavaScript 30!</p>

    <p>For those who don't know what the JavaScript 30 is, it's <a href="https://javascript30.com" target="blank">a 30
        day coding challenge</a> designed to teach and improve your vanilla JavaScript skills. No frameworks (React), no
      libraries (JQuery) - just plain ol' JavaScript.</p>

    <p>For the people out there who don't know who <i>I</i> am, my name is <a href="http://jamescalingo.dev"
        target="blank">James Calingo</a> and I’m a developer striving to
      be the very best. Right now, I am looking for work, but I feel that my skills and knowledge are probably around
      70-80% of where they should be due to reasons. That’s why I’m doing this challenge.</p>

    <p>The first thing I had to do was to set up this whole page. The second thing was to try and figure out how to CSS
      this thing. Like I said earlier, the point of the JavaScript 30 is to learn pure JavaScript - no libraries, no
      frameworks, nothing. In the spirit of that, I wanted to try and create this site without the use of any Bootstrap
      stuff (I've been using it almost constantly since I learned it).</p>

    <p>Designing your own CSS ain't so easy. I had to use a Scrimba course to try and create a nice blog-like atmosphere
      without Boostrap. I also had other things I considered for this page, but in the end, I think I'll stick with this
      simple CSS for now. I may change it later though.</p>

    <p>One other thing about this whole project:<br>
      I know that this is meant to be a JavaScript project, but I've been trying to learn TypeScript as well. I'm sure
      most developers reading this know what that is, but for those who don't know, TypeScript is basically a stricter
      version of JavaScript (and that is at a VERY basic level). It's super useful to catch errors in your code BEFORE
      trying to run it, but due to its restrictions compared to the free-flowing JavaScript, it's tricky to incorporate
      it.</p>

    <p>One of my ideas was to incorporate more TypeScript into this by making everything .ts files instead of .js files,
      but I decided against that.<br>(Slight spoilers: one of the big reasons why will be apparent tomorrow)
    </p>

    <p>In somewhat unrelated news, those of you who are GitHub savvy and <a
        href="https://github.com/JamesCalingo/jcjs30112020" target="blank">check out the repo for this project</a> will
      probably notice that the default branch is named "main" instead of "master". I had no clue that GitHub made that
      change (and it must have been recent too since I last created a repo a little over a week ago), and while I do
      have my guesses as to why they did it (see <a
        href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/realtors-master-bedroom-bathroom-terminology/" target="blank">This
        article</a> about the renaming of the "master bedroom" in Texas), I'm not going to comment any further on it. I
      just have to remember that I have to git push to "main" instead of "master" from now on.</p>
