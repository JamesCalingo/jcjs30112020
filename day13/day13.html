      <h1>DAY 13: Scroll Sliding</h1>
      <h2>View the finished product here...by which I mean HERE, on this page.</h2>

<p>Some people might refer to this as the "Cris Collinsworth": as you scroll down the page, images slide into slots that have been left for them.</p>

<p>Today is VERY strange for quite a few reasons. First of all, since this is being done in November of 2020, today is actually Friday the 13th. Secondly, you may not have realized this, but on the home page, the app and blog links for today go to the same place. There's a reason for this, and you'll see it VERY soon (of course, you would probably be thrown off by the different formatting compared to the rest of the blog posts - there's a reason for that of course).</p>

<p>Hopefully I've written enough text here so that the first image will slide in at the start of the NEXT paragraph. I can't be certain, however, because I don't know how big the screen you're using is. Odds are that based on my testing of this while writing this whole thing, your window will have scrolled even just a little bit because the 27" monitor I use is close to scrolling, but then again, you could be reading this on a giant TV. Before you ask why anyone would use a TV as their computer monitor, I've seen it before. I don't know if it's entirely healthy due to reasons, but I've seen it.</p>

<p>If everything worked successfully, this paragraph will start a bit on the right and there will be an image of (whatever the image is actually of) sliding in from the left right about here. Of course, I'll be testing this BEFORE it goes up, so I'll know if it worked or not. Also, this is being done using floats: my bio on my portfolio actually has a float as well (though no sliding images). (To me reading this in the future: Congratulations! It works like a charm! Also, be careful if you scroll through the page REALLY fast...things may end up goofing.)</p>

<p>The process I did for this is completely different from every other day of this JavaScript 30 that I've done. For those who don't know (though I've been alluding to it a few times in these blog posts), there's a repository with starter code and finished code that you can use to cross-reference your starter code with.</p>

<p>I wrote the JS in THAT folder on my computer (I copied it before starting this project because I wasn't sure how I was gonna do this), and then copied it here. I had no idea what I was going to do, but I did want to make sure the JS worked, and it did.</p>

<p>You're probably wondering why I did this. Well, there's a story behind it, but first...</p>

<img src="http://unsplash.it/400/401" alt="An image. Due to the random nature of these images I cannot tell you what it is." class="slide-in align-right">

<p>Now, this paragraph (or the next one as I learned while doing this) should feature an image on the RIGHT of it. I don't know how it will be formatted when writing this in HTML, but I think it's going to make it so that the text is on the left while the image slides in on the right. Also, this paragraph ends RIGHT about where the image ends on my 27" monitor, so here's a sentence that only exists due to this fact. Again, depending on what size screen you're reading this on, it will vary, but for my purposes, I need more text here.</p>

<p>Anyway, what was I going to talk about? Oh, right, why I formatted today completely differently from just about all the other days of this project.</p>

<p>If you've been following this project (or assuming you're going through these day by day like a normal person), you've noticed that there were a few days where I basically had "no app" and just did some behind the scenes stuff (Days 4, 7, and 9). Unlike all of those days, however, this one actually focuses on client-facing JavaScript (i.e. things that are on the webpage) as opposed to just console stuff.</p>

<img src="http://unsplash.it/200/500" alt="An image. Due to the random nature of these images I cannot tell you what it is." class="align-left slide-in">

<p>Because of the client-facing nature of today's work, I wanted to come up with something interesting to write that would be interesting enough to go along with a blog post. Ironically, the hardest part of this was coming up with what to write for it. I COULD have easily just used Lorem Ipsum or some dumb copy/paste thing, but that's no fun...so insead, I'm just decided to use this "hybrid app/blog post" to showcase the thing that's going to happen. In fact, <img src="http://unsplash.it/200/200" alt="An image. Due to the random nature of these images I cannot tell you what it is." class="align-right slide-in"> I just stuck another img (image) tag INSIDE this sentence! This probably looks a little ridiculous right now (and especially on mobile, since I'm using dev tools to see how this looks on mobile), but I hope by now I've proven how these animations work. I should probably also mention that the reason the text is narrower than normal (at least on larger screens) is because of the images: essentially, the narrower text field means that the page is forced to scroll.</p>

<p>I've pretty much run out of things to say, and you're probably bored of hearing me ramble and ramble by now to fill air and page time, but I do want to mention ONE MORE THING:</p>

<img src="http://unsplash.it/400/400" alt="A repeat of the first image on the page." class="align-right slide-in">

<p>First, compare the image here to the first image on the page.</p>

<p>Second, refresh the page, scroll through again (but not too fast), and see what happens.</p>

<p>Also, because this last image is actually messing up my footer, here's some filler text:</p>

<p>Ecce! In pictura is puella, nomine Cornelia. Cornelia est puella Romana quae in Italia habitat. Etiam in pictura est villa rustica ubi Cornelia aestate habitat. Cornelia est laeta quod iam in villa habitat. Cornelia iam sub arbore sedet et legit. Etiam in pictura est altera puella, nomine Flavia. Flavia est puella Romana quae in villa vicina habitat. Dum Cornelia legit, Flavia scribit. Laeta est Flavia quod Cornelia iam in villa habitat.</p>

<p>Shoutout to those who also took Latin in grade school.</p>

<p>(If the footer links are still messed up on your screen, then I don't know what to tell you...'cause I'm pretty sure there's a max-width property on this page - which I completely forgot about until I checked this out on my laptop screen.)</p>
