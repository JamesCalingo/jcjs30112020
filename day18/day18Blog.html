    <h1>DAY 18: Time Calculator</h1>
    <h2><a href="day18.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

    <p>I think I mentioned this before in a previous blog entry, but I (used to) record A LOT of video. One day, when
      trying to assess just how much video I've recorded, I found a site that adds timecodes together.</p>

    <p>This is basically another version of that app: it adds timecodes together and tells you how much total time there
      is.</p>

    <p>...Is what I thought this would be when seeing it in the course list. When I went to watch the video, I realized
      that this is something COMPLETELY different: it's using data-attributes for times and then uses array methods to
      calculate the total time.</p>

    <p>I went back and forth about making the video calculator: on one hand, it's not actually what today's lesson is
      about...but it is relevant, so I decided to try it. You can probably tell by looking at the application how that
      went.</p>

    <p>Honestly, it was really not that challenging to do. I borrowed a few ideas from Day 15, threw in a bit of today's
      code, added a few things here and there, and voila! A fully functional app!</p>

    <p>There were a few interesting challenges in getting this to where I wanted it to be:</p>


    <p>First, I should mention that the <code>number</code> type for inputs is <i>wonderful</i>. Only a handful of non
      number inputs are allowed in (+, -, ., and, for some reason, e), but it will only work if the number is an integer
      (whole number), so decimals and e (which is a constant value of 2.somethingIforget) don't work (I did not try
      entering pi though, mainly because I don't know how to do it easily). There are a few things to keep in mind
      though:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Negatives. I had to make a thing to catch if the user accidentally tried to use negative values, 'cause
          those will cause the app to FREAK OUT.</li>
        <li>Leading zeros. I wanted to have a thing where the app would add zeroes to minute and second values, but this
          led to a bevy of quirks: if the user already put in the leading zero, then you'd have a three digit value; if
          the user put in too many leading zeroes, then those would all end up rendering. I came up with a complex
          looking solution that basically chains a few ternary operators together; it's not actually that complicated,
          but if you're new to JS, then it might look funny.</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>Also, remember how I said that repetition is generally not a great idea in code? I had to do it here in order to have
      the minutes and seconds display "properly" (that is, with leading 0s if they're less than 10). I should note, however, that the method I mentioned above is SLIGHTLY different for the total time calculation in that it doesn't require a second ternary operator (or at least it's not SUPPOSED to unless someone decides to break into the code somehow). It might be okay
      here since they're actually pointing to VERY DIFFERENT values using slightly different processes (plus the fact that most users won't try and hack into the total time value), but I also renamed them between functions for no
      real reason, so...</p>

    <p>One of the main things I can see myself adding to this is a "remove" feature to take out any errant data. Other
      than that, I think this is pretty signifcant for me because it's starting to show that turn from acquiring
      knowledge to applying it, which is what I think is the most important thing to gain from this project.</p>

    <p>Also, this is probably one of the few times where JavaScript's type coercion may have been actually
      beneficial...if I hadn't used <code>parseFloat( )</code>.</p>
