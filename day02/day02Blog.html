    <h1>DAY 02: CSS + JS Clock</h1>
    <h2><a href="day02.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

    <p>It's a clock. That's really it. Coincidentally, this is going up the day after the United States switched back to
      "standard" time from Daylight Savings.</p>

    <p>I kinda wish I had more to say about this app, but I really don't. The biggest blocker in getting this done was,
      of all things, a spacing issue with adjusting the CSS.</p>

    <p>You may notice some of the werid quirkiness of the clock though, like when it takes a second or two when loading
      the page to snap into position or when the hands all freak out when the minute changes. I know there are ways to
      fix at least the second problem, but I'm not sure if they're worth investing time in (heh) just because this is
      meant to be a simple app and honestly, it's not super useful (who uses analog clocks anymore anyways?).</p>

    <p>Also, I decided that since there is not a lot going on CSS and JS wise, everything is in one file instead of my
      usual system of creating an assets folder for the CSS and JS.</p>
