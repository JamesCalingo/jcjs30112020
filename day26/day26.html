    <h1>DAY 26: Dropdowns</h1>
    <h2>View the finished product up top</h2>


    <p>Once again, I'm just going to integrate the app with the blog post because it's a component. However, this is the
      last time I'm going to be doing this.</p>

      <p>Remember back on Day 22 when I did the thing that highlighted <code>a</code> elements and said it was a preview of something? That something is actually today's app. You can see what today's app is by hovering over the "About" tab above: It's a thing for animating different dropdown boxes.</p>

    <p>Once again, I moved the links that are normally at the bottom of this page to the top. What's different, however,
      is their presentation: They're now grouped together in the "Navigation Links" tab. I also randomly threw in links to my portfolio and blog today just to further showcase the effect.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, one of the biggest challenges was the non-link text in the dropdowns. It took a bit longer than expected because I couldn't just set the text color in the dropdown class to white: I had to go to each individual element inside the dropdown class and set them. Technically, you can do it all in one shot (which I did), but it is a bit inconvenient, especially if you end up having a ton of CSS rules...</p>

      <p>Outside of that, this one was fairly straightforward and there's really not much more I can say about it except that be aware that it might freak out a bit if you move your mouse rapidly over the navbar and that it's based on the website for eCommerce software <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="blank">Stripe</a>. I don't know if I have any projects where this would be useful, but I can definitely see where it could be used (again, Stripe).</p>

      <p>There is one other thing I should mention: I'm not sure how this will work on mobile, since it did some kinda weird stuff when I tested it...</p>

      <p>Also, since this is going up on American Thanksgiving 2020, Happy Thanksgiving y'all! This year more than ever has given us a lot to be thankful about whether we like it or not...</p>
