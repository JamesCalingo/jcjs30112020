      <h1>DAY 8: Canvas Fun</h1>
      <h2><a href="day8.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

      <p>This one's simple: just doodle on the canvas by clicking on it and dragging your mouse around. It's a nice way to destress from a long coding/testing/debugging session or some other stressful event.</p>

      <p>This actually reminded me of a minigame from an old video game I used to play where you drew lines and they'd change colors for a bit before disappearing. This one doesn't have disappearing lines, but it does do some other things.</p>

      <p>First, you'll notice that the color of your lines is constantly changing. That's a neat little trick with the hue; 0 and 360 are both red, so by adjusting the hue you can adjust the color of the lines. What's even neater is that once you go past 360, it just keeps cycling through the colors - you don't need to reset your hue variable to 0! There's a mathematical explanation for this that I'm not going to fully get into, but long story short: this is based on how circles work (as evidenced by the 360 value being the same as the 0 value).</p>

      <p>The other thing you'll probably notice is that the width of your strokes changes as you draw - going from narrow to wide and then back to narrow. This is a neat trick where you increace the width, then once you get to a certain point you tell the program to decrease the width until you get to the original width, then tell it to go back up again. That's probably not the best explanation for what's going on, but I do hope you understand what's going on.</p>

      <p>I wish I had a better way of smoothing out the drawing stuff, because in playing with the max width I (accidentally) found a way to make it look like the cursor is "spinning", and it's honestly a REALLY cool effect; if I could smooth it out somehow it'd be even better.</p>

      <p>(Also, ts-check does NOT like some of the stuff in here AT ALL)</p>
