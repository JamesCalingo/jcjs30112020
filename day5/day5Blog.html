      <h1>DAY 5: Flex Panels</h1>
      <h2><a href="day5.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

      <p>When I saw what this was going to be, I was super excited for it - so much so that I contemplated doing it a day early (there were other reasons I thought about it, but I won't get into that right now).</p>

      <p>This is basically just a component where you can have multiple panels that grown and shrink on click. However, it looks <i>cool</i>, and the ability to integrate this into other sites is super neat and exciting.</p>

      <p>I wasn't sure what to do with this one, but given what's been going on recently, I ended up to base this on <a href="https://www.tetriseffect.game/" target="blank">Tetris Effect</a>. The background images are things I found online; I realize the second one makes the word at the top near impossible to read due to the lightness, but there's no real way for me to fix that without a WHOLE MESS of CSSing that's frankly not super necessary I think. The words are based on a song from the game called "Connected"; if you haven't heard this song yet, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HuDnXloq2s" target="blank">check it out here</a> 'cause I LOVE it.</p>

      <p>Consider this a prototype for something in the future: my goal for this is to turn it into a component I can use on my portfolio to list the things that I know/want to learn. For that, I gotta figure out how to consolidate things, 'cause there is a MASSIVE CSS list here that I'm not sure how to use with my React portfolio. I also have to "figure out" how to make the text animations work (i.e. having the list title in the center when not open, then transitioning it to the top while the list slides in from the bottom).</p>

      <p>(P.S.: I've actually never played Tetris Effect due to me owning only a Nintendo Switch and a MacBook with not enough room to install Windows. I DO hope to have something I can play it on soon though...)</p>
