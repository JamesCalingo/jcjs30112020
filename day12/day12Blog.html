      <h1>DAY 12: Key Sequence Detection</h1>
      <h2><a href="day12.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

<p>Key sequence detection is the name of the game today. There's a certain set of keys you need to input to get a secret, but I'm not going to say what that sequence is or how long it is.</p>

<p>Originally, I tried using something called Cornify because the video for today mentioned it, but it did some WEIRD stuff (not to mention their website doesn't work). I ended up settling on using <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/" target="blank">SweetAlert2</a>, which I typically use for alerts on my other work.</p>

<p>Nothing in this was SUPER new to me. One of the first web apps I ever made was a <a href="https://jamescalingo.dev/PsychicGame/" target="blank">"Guess the Letter" game</a> which used key detection to try and match guesses to a randomly selected letter, so in essence this is something I've done before, but with a twist.</p>

<p>Arrays are used in this one, and it actually led to a bit more complexity. For those who don't know (and this is important for you budding developers), arrays CANNOT be directly compared; you have to somehow manipulate them if you want to compare them. In my case, I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify" target="blank">JSON.stringify( )</a> to make the comparison; basically, it turns your array into a string and then those can be compared.</p>

<p>Mobile users, sadly, get the short end of the stick on this one again. I thought about adding a text field for them like in the app I linked above, but then I realized that there's something I did which is unavailable on mobile (hint hint...).</p>

<p>I honestly went a bit overboard with this one...which you can see if you know how to find my secrets. Speaking of which, there may be a clue to the sequence hiding in plain sight...though there's probably a large subset of those reading this who will find the clue but can't figure out the CODE.</p>
