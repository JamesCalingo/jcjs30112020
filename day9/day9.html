    <h1>These console tricks are sure to blow your mind!</h1>

    <p>So...you're probably wondering why today's "app" looks just like one of my blog posts.</p>

    <p>That's because, like days 4 and 7, there's no app today: it's just pure JS stuff. Unlike those days, however,
      we're not doing anything with array methods; instead, we're going to discuss a bunch of random things you can do
      with the console!</p>

    <p>For you non-JS savvy folk, the console allows a JavaScript developer to see important things: uncaught errors,
      variables and their types, and so much more. This is commonly done by using <code>console.log()</code>.</p>

    <p>However, there are a lot of things you can do with the console besides just passing in variable names and
      primitives (numbers, strings, and booleans).</p>

    <p>The first one is somewhat random and obscure: if you put <code>%s</code> into a string you're console.logging, you can
      then define a value to put into the string for the <code>%s</code>, like this:</p>

    <code>console.log("This is %s", "Madness!")</code>

    <p>You're unlikely to have much need for this, however, since template literal has basically replaced concatenation
      as the primary method of doing stuff like this.</p>

    <p>The next method, however, is more amusing: if you put <code>%c</code> at the start of whatever string you're
      console.logging, you can actually style it like using CSS!</p>

    <code>console.log("%c THIS. IS. SPARTA!", "font-size: 60px")</code>

    <p>Now, we're going to get into other <code>console._____</code> methods:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>Console.warn()</code>, which will print a warning such as <code>"This is a bad idea..."</code></li>
      <li><code>Console.error()</code>, which will print an error like <code>"You can't do that genius!"</code> You've
        probably seen a ton of error messages, but may not have been aware that you could actually make your own.</li>
      <li><code>Console.info()</code>, which will print an informative statement like <code>"Info statements have a blue
          background."</code></li>
      <li><code>Console.assert()</code>, which will run a test on whatever you pass in and then produce a statement if
        it's false,
        such as <code>2 + 2 === 4, "Nope. Gotta love JavaScript!"</code>
        <br>or
        <br>
        <code>"2" + 2 === 4, "Nope. Gotta
          love JavaScript!"</code>
        <br>
        This one's actually kinda useful to check if your HTML elements have specific classes or ids attached to them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I should mention that when you check each of these methods in the console except for info, they will tell you who
      called them and where the call was made.</p>

    <p>There are a few others as well:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Console.dir()</code> allows you to view an object of properties for a DOM element</li>
      <li><code>Console.group()</code> lets you group multiple <code>console.log()</code> statements together (I
        could've used this a few days ago...)</li>
      <li><code>Console.count()</code> shows you how many times you <code>console.log()</code> the same thing</li>
      <li><code>Console.time()</code> tells you how long a certain action takes</li>
      <li><code>Console.table()</code> takes an array and formats it as a table (I used this back on day 4)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is one more method, but I don't recommend using it unless you have a VERY GOOD reason:
      <code>console.clear()</code>. You can probably guess what it does and why I don't recommend it.</p>

    <p>So that's some things you can do with the console. Whether or not any of this is actually useful depends on your
      needs, but I hope you learned something from this - I certainly did. If you want to know more about any of these,
      you can always check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Jsref/obj_console.asp">w3schools</a> or <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console">Mozilla's docs</a> to learn more.</p>
