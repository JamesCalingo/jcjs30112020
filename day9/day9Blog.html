    <h1>DAY 9: Dev Tool Magic!</h1>
    <h2><a href="day9.html">Read about console methods</a></h2>

    <p>Today, y'all get TWO blogs for the price of 1!</p>

    <p>That's because today's "app" is just going over some interesting console stuff. I wrote all about it in the "app" post, so go
      over there if you want to see the magic.</p>

    <p>However, there are a few behind the scenes things I'd like to discuss:</p>

    <p>First of all, I originally had script tags running alongside the JS to show examples of what I was discussing IN THE CONSOLE. However, due to increasing frustrations with the console methods bloating my code, I decided to drop the idea. If you read closely, you can see the exact moment when I gave up (sorry).</p>

    <p>Second, I don't know what happened, but the text-wrapping thing on the day9 file stopped working, making thins
      much more difficult to format (and it's part of the reason why I gave up the JavaScripting).</p>

    <p>To wrap up today, I'd like to discuss something interesting I learned in the process of setting up this project.
      I mentioned this in passing on day 4, said I'd explain it later, and that "later" is now:</p>

    <p>Originally, I had days 0-9 styled as double digits (“day00”, “day01, “day02”, etc.) If you’re at all familiar
      with how computers (apparently used to) function, you might know why I did this, but for those who aren’t:</p>

    <p>When I did this, I was under the understanding that computers “alphabetize” numbers based on their first digit -
      no matter how long the number is. Say you had a bunch of files numbered 1-19. If you sorted these files by name,
      you might be surprised when it shows up as </p>

    <ul>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>10</li>
      <li>11</li>
      <li>12</li>
      <li>and so on</li>
    </ul>
    <p>instead of</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>and so on</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By putting a 0 in front of the digit for single digit numbers, we can essentially “trick” the computer into
      thinking they’re first in order, which they’re supposed to be.</p>

    <p>However, a little poking around showed that this wasn’t the case - the computer can count properly without taking
      the tens digit into account. This may be due to the fact that I have the files as “dayxx” as opposed to starting
      with the numbers, but I’m honestly not sure. I will note, however, that my code editor does sort my files in the
      method I described above, which now that I'm in double digits is both a blessing and a curse once I get to the
      20s.</p>

    <p>Also, the reason I started at 0 is because that’s where a lot of programming languages start counting for those
      who weren’t aware (you get used to the after a while). It also made sense to me because I wanted it to represent
      the sort of "pre-project" phase - not doing any actual JS30 work, just getting the environment for it ready. </p>

    <p>P.S.: There is a reason I kept 2 as 02 though. It’s a reference to one of my favorite television shows from my
      childhood - I won't say which one, though, but I think most of my friends were fans of the same thing when they
      were kids too.</p>
