      <h1>DAY 27: Click and Scroll</h1>
      <h2><a href="day27.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>
        
        <p>Today's app should seem kinda familiar to anyone who owned an Apple product in the mid-to-late 2000s: It's a component that scrolls sideways (you may see a scroll bar below the panel). Not only that, but you can also click and drag to scroll as well; this is important because unless I'm mistaken, most computer mouses (mice?) generally don't have a good way of scrolling sideways.</p>
        
        <p>This project, like a lot of the other ones, was fairly simple and straightforward. I did, however, make a few CSS changes to try and better emulate the aforementioned "mid-to-late 200s iPod Touch aesthetic though.</p>
        
        <p>However, I'd going to discuss something completely different! Well, it's not <b>completely</b> different (and is in fact quite related to this as you'll see in a sec):<br>Yesterday, while poking around the internet, I found a program called <a href="http://brackets.io/" target="blank">Brackets</a>. It's a text/code editor designed for web development, but one of the things that really drew me in was its <b><i>live updating</i></b> feature, where you can see your HTML document update in real time; for example, you can watch this sentence populate itself on your page while typing it in the editor.</p>
        
        <p>You readers out there obviously can't see it since this page is finished, but trust me when I say that the live updating is kinda awesome - I did all of today's work with Brackets mostly to check it out. One of the biggest things that the live updating fixes is the need to constantly refresh your page when trying to make sure it works; just open the HTML file you're working with while updating the JS and it will update in real time (for proof, leave the console open).</p>
            
        <p>It does seem a bit limited though: as far as I can tell, it's more meant for front end stuff (HTML, CSS, and JS) and not much else (like backend/full stack work), and I haven't tried it with a framework like React (or Angular, which uses TypeScript) yet, but I would like to explore it some more. In fact, I'm a little sad I found it just now, because I'm strongly considering using it to finish the rest of this project...</p>
