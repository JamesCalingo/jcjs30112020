  <h1>DAY 0: This whole site.</h1>
  <p>This is NOT one of the JavaScript 30 projects. Heck, this isn't even a JS thing - it's just me setting up the HTML and CSS of this site!</p>

<p>Why am I making this post then? It's because this whole process took a bit longer than I expected.</p>

<p>The first thing I had to do was try and figure out how to CSS this thing. The point of the JavaScript 30 is to learn pure JavaScript - no libraries, no frameworks, nothing. In the spirit of that, I wanted to try and create this site without the use of any Bootstrap stuff (I've been using it almost constantly since I learned it).</p>

<p>Designing your own CSS ain't so easy. I had to use a Scrimba course to try and create a nice blog-like atmosphere without Boostrap.</p>

<p>I ended up creating my own CSS for the cards you see on the main page. Yes, I know that I could've used React to just iterate over an object with all the data, but again, I'm trying to do all of this without frameworks.</p>
