  <h1>DAY 0: This whole site.</h1>
  <h2>(NOTE: There is no link for this one)</h2>
  <p>This is NOT one of the JavaScript 30 projects. Heck, this isn't even a JS thing - it's just me setting up the HTML and CSS of this site!</p>

<p>Why am I making this post then? It's because this whole process took a bit longer than I expected.</p>

<p>The first thing I had to do was try and figure out how to CSS this thing. The point of the JavaScript 30 is to learn pure JavaScript - no libraries, no frameworks, nothing. In the spirit of that, I wanted to try and create this site without the use of any Bootstrap stuff (I've been using it almost constantly since I learned it).</p>

<p>Designing your own CSS ain't so easy. I had to use a Scrimba course to try and create a nice blog-like atmosphere without Boostrap.</p>

<p>In somewhat unrelated news, those of you who are GitHub savvy and <a href="https://github.com/JamesCalingo/jcjs30112020" target="blank">check out the repo for this project</a> will probably notice that the default branch is named "main" instead of "master". I had no clue that GitHub made that change (and it must have been recent too since I last created a repo a little over a week ago), and while I do have my guesses as to why they did it (see <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/realtors-master-bedroom-bathroom-terminology/" target="blank">This article</a> about the renaming of the "master bedroom" in Texas), I'm not going to comment any further on it. I just have to remember that I have to git push to "main" instead of "master" from now on.</p>
