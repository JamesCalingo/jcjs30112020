      <h1>DAY 19: Photobooth</h1>
      <h2><a href="day19.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

      <p>Those of you of a certain age (and/or who have used a Mac ever) are probably aware of a program known as <b>Photobooth</b>. Basically, it's an application to take photos of yourself.</p>

      <p>In the modern era of (the situation of November 2020), where a lot of communications are done via webcams and the internet, it's a great way to make sure that your background looks neat and as professional as it can be (in case your Zoom virtual background keeps eating your head and/or body).</p>

      <p>This is...basically Photobooth for the internet. Ish. You can use the sliders above to adjust the RGB levels if you're interested, and there are other things </p>

      <p>Today also featured the instructional video being quite out of date! There's something that got deprecated by the major browsers in there, and it was really weird trying to figure out why my code wasn't working when it matched the video until I decided to look at the solved version and saw that.</p>

      <p>It also features a package.json file and, when it was created, required the use of a server. This is big because i</p>

      <p>This is only as good as your webcam is, so if you're like me and somehow still have a late 2000s webcam lying around somewhere, don't try using that unless you want super grainy images (maybe as a throwback). Of course, you also have to make sure your webcam isn't blocked (for those who block their cams so that the government doesn't see their faces when they watch...certain potentially educational content).</p>
