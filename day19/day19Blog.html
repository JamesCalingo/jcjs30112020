      <h1>DAY 19: Online Photobooth</h1>
      <h2><a href="day19.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

      <p>Those of you of a certain age (and/or who have used a Mac ever) are probably aware of a program known as <b>Photobooth</b>. Basically, it's an application to take photos of yourself.</p>

      <p>In the modern era of (the situation of November 2020), where a lot of communications are done via webcams and the internet, it's a great way to make sure that you and your surroundings look neat and as professional for important meetings (especially if your Zoom virtual background keeps eating your head and/or body; also you probably shouldn't be using a virtual background for interviews).</p>

      <p>This is...basically Photobooth for the internet. Ish. When you open the page for the first time, it will ask for camera permission; if you don't give the app permission, it won't work. You can then take photos with the "Take photo" button, which will then show your photos below the camera view. When you click on a photo, you'll be able to download it.</p>
        
        <p>You can also use the sliders above to adjust the RGB levels if you're interested, and there are other things you can do if you know how to mess with them (insert wink emoji here). I'm honestly not entirely sure what the sliders do, but I believe they're tied to chroma-key events (i.e. green screening).</p>

      <p>Today also featured the instructional video being quite out of date! There's something that got deprecated by the major browsers in there, and it was really weird trying to figure out why my code wasn't working when it matched the video until I decided to look at the solved version and saw that.</p>

      <p>It also features a package.json file and, when it was created (at least four years ago based on what I saw on GitHub), required the use of a server for security reasons. This is big because if I needed a server, I'm pretty sure I'd have to deploy the app on a different service like Heroku* or Firebase due to certain limitations on GitHub pages. However, when I went to go try the app serverless, it worked! It may be due to a complete lack of Node/Express on this thing, but then again, my portfolio page uses React and works fine without any additional hosting.</p>

      <p>This app is only as good as your webcam is, so if you're like me and somehow still have a late 2000s webcam lying around somewhere, don't try using that unless you want super grainy images (maybe as a throwback). Of course, you also have to make sure your webcam isn't blocked (for those who block their cams so that the government doesn't see their faces when they watch...certain content that rhymes with "corn").</p>

      <p>*Heroku is some bootcamps' tool of choice when deploying apps with a server, but I've been told that it's not well liked among hiring managers, so be aware of that when using it...</p>
