      <h1>DAY 11: Video Player</h1>
      <h2><a href="day11.html">View the finished product here</a></h2>

      <p>It's a video player! Play and pause the video. You can also adjust the volume or playback speed, plus there's buttons to skip ahead/back.</p>

      <p>You may be wondering what's so special about this video player. For that, I'd like you to compare the video player in the app to a simple video HTML tag (which is something I had no idea existed before today). If the video doesn't seem to work, right click on it and select "Show Controls" and it SHOULD work.</p>

      <video src="assets/video.mp4" autoplay></video>

      <p>You'll note how the control areas (play/pause, volume control, progress bar, etc) are VERY different (and also the lack of a playback speed adjuster on this page's video). That's basically what today's app is.</p>

      <p>This one was a DOOZY to do. There's a LOT going on, and the JS for this, while fairly straightforward, looks kinda messy at times just due to how everything's done.</p>

      <p>I also added a little feature to the player: A little thing that shows you the value you change the sliders to. I did this because I wanted to know what I changed values to so that I could adjust based on that (mainly the playback speed). The good news is that it changes consistently based on what you adjust the video to; the less good news is that it's persistent - once the change is made, the value stays there until it's changed again (which doesn't look clean IMO). I could add a timeOut function to remove the value, but I'm not sure if it's worth it right now.</p>
    
      <p>As someone who (used to) do a lot of video stuff, I may come back to this if I ever wanted to do my own video hosting or something.</p>
