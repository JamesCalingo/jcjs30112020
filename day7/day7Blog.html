      <h1>DAY 7: Array Methods 2: Electric Boogaloo</h1>
      <h2><a href="day7.html">View the arrays here</a></h2>


      <p>This one's more array stuff. There's really not much more I can say about it.</p>

      <p>Most of my thoughts on this are the same as on <a href="../day4/day4Blog.html">Day 4 of this project</a>. Much like that one, I'm actually going to include the JavaScript in this page as well so you can see the "magic" here as well.</p>

      <p>These methods are newer to me then the ones on Day 4 though, so learning them is definitely nice.</p>

      <p>There is one thing I will say about this one, though:</p>

      <p>The last two methods involve finding things; however, the actual value being sought in the array (the id) is used in writing the functions.</p>

      <p>My question is how would that work in the real world? If I was using these methods to develop an API in the real world, I most certainly would not hard code in an id value because that would make the function only work in those specific conditions, which is very much a bad idea.</p>
