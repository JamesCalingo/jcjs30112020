    <h1>DAY 14: JS30 PROGRESS REPORT</h1>
    <h2><a href="day14.html">View Copy vs. Reference</a></h2>

    <p>This is a progress report for the JavaScript 30 as a whole. If you want to see the actual course content for
      today, it's another article/blog post, and you can see it by using the link above (as usual). I also put a link at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <p>Under most circumstances, I would probably do this on day 15 since that's the actual halfway point, but the thing
      is that day 15 is the longest video in the course and appears to have a sweet app attached to it, so I'm going to
      do this now.</p>

    <p>This JavaScript 30 is just about halfway done, and I feel like I've learned a lot from it. It's definitely taken
      a different turn from what I expected, and I have sensed that I'm learning more from it than I have from other
      tutorials.</p>

    <p>I think the biggest benefit from it, outside of the whole JavaScript thing, is me learning about non-Bootstrap
      web development. For instance, anyone who's used VSCode before (which is, from what I've seen, around half the
      field) may know that if you type <code>!bcdn</code> in a blank HTML document, you get a template for a HTML
      document with Bootstrap preinstalled. However, if you just type in <code>!</code>, then you get a super basic HTML
      template with a viewport tag - something fairly important for responsive design.</p>

    <p>I went in fairly blind, so when I found out that this project wasn't necessarily 30 "apps", I wasn't sure how to
      deal with the days where there's no real app to present. By now, you noticed that I have two different ways of
      dealing with the "non-apps", if you will. The first two (days 4 and 7) were done by displaying the data used on a
      page and then having everything else in the console; day 9 is when I switched to a more informative way of dealing
      with the material. I don't know if I should go back to days 4 and 7 and write about the methods used there, but I
      did like how I tried using the console to do things.</p>

    <p>There's a lot of cool things that have already come up in this project (such as days 5, and 6), and looking at
      the rest of the 30, there's more cool things to come. I won't spoil it for those who don't know, but there's a lot
      of things in there that I can see myself using in the future.</p>

    <p>There's probably more I could say here, but I'd like to wait for the second half of this before I go making any
      conclusions on the whole thing. I'll just say that I've definitely gained quite a bit from what's been done so
      far, and am looking forward to the rest of it.</p>
